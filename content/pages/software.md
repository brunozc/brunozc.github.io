I enjoy translating the research that I do into software that can be used by engineers and practitioners.

Here you can find some of the open source projects that I have been working on.


## Numerical models
### Rose
[Rose](https://bitbucket.org/DeltaresGEO/rose/) is a train/track interaction model.
It can simulate the passage of trains, changes in track stiffness and the presence of discontinuities along the railway track.

### Scatter
[Scatter](https://bitbucket.org/DeltaresGEO/scatter/) is a 3D FEM model that models wave propagation on spatial varying subsoil.

With Scatter it is also possible to model the passage of train on spatial varying subsoil.

## Data

### ROSE dashboard

Dashboard to visualise the results obtained by combining [Rose](https://bitbucket.org/DeltaresGEO/rose/) with railway track data.
